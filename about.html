          <p>Founded by Neha Panda, Vyomi Shah, Priya Pokhrel, and Hailey Chen, this is your personal launchpad for building unshakable confidence and conquering challenges you've always dreamed of tackling.</p> 
          <p></p>
          <p>Did you know? <i>Harvard Business Review</i> found that women typically apply for roles only when they meet 100% of qualifications, while men apply at just 60%. That self-doubt<br/>ends here.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>At iRocket, we empower you to:</p>
          <p>&#10024; <b>Own your worth - </b>You're more qualified than you think</p>
          <p>&#10024; <b>Take bold leaps - </b>Grow through challenges tailored just for you</p>
          <p>&#10024; <b>Build career momentum - </b>With skills that propel you forward</p>
          <h2><b>Your confidence revolution starts today.</b></h2>
