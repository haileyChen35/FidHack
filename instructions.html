            <!-- Step 1: Taking the initial confidence quiz -->
            <h2><b>1. Take your confidence quiz</b></h2>
            <p>Start with a quick assessment to pinpoint exactly where to focus your growth-whether it's self-advocacy, public speaking, or owning your achievements.</p>
            <br>
            <!-- Step 2: Getting a custom growth plan -->
            <h2><b>2. Get your personalized plan</b></h2>
            <p>We'll generate a custom calendar packed with daily confidence challenges tailored just for you. Each task is designed to stretch your comfort zone in manageable steps.</p>
            <br>
            <!-- Step 3: Earning points and building a streak -->
            <h2><b>3. Earn Points & Build Momentum</b></h2>
            <p><b>Small steps = Big wins:</b> Complete individual steps to rack up points.</p>
            <p><b>Bonus boost:</b> Finish the full task for extra rewards.</p>
            <p><b>Streak rewards</b> Consecutive days of completed tasks? That's a streak! Keep it alive to unlock achievements.</p>
            <br>
            <!-- Step 4: Streaks and resets explained -->
            <h2><b>4. Rise or Reset</b></h2>
            <p><b>Keep climbing:</b> Every full task you complete extends your streak.</p>
            <p><b>No judgement, just progress:</b> Miss a day? Your streak resets, but your progress never disappears. <i>Tomorrow is a fresh start.</i></p>
            <p><b>Why It Works: </b>Tiny, consistent actions rewire your brain for confidence. Think of it like a workout, but for your courage.</p>
            <!-- Closing call to action -->
            <h2><b>Ready to transform "I can't" into "I did"?</b></h2>
