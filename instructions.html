            <h2><b>1. Take your confidence quiz</b></h2>
            <p>Start with a quick assessment to pinpoint exactly where to focus your growth-whether it's self-<br/>advocacy, public speaking, or owning your achievements.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h2><b>2. Get your personalized plan</b></h2>
            <p>We'll generate a custom calendar packed with daily confidence challenges tailored just for you. Each<br/>task is designed to stretch your comfort zone in manageable steps.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h2><b>3. Earn Points & Build Momentum</b></h2>
            <p><b>Small steps = Big wins:</b> Complete individual steps to rack up points.</p>
            <p><b>Bonus boost:</b> Finish the full task for extra rewards.</p>
            <p><b>Streak rewards</b> Consecutive days of completed tasks? That's a streak! Keep it alive to unlock achievements.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h2><b>4. Rise or Reset</b></h2>
            <p><b>Keep climbing:</b> Every full task you complete extends your streak.</p>
            <p><b>No judgement, just progress:</b> Miss a day? Your streak resets, but your progress never disappears.<br/>Tomorrow is a fresh start.</p>
            <p><b>Why It Works: </b>Tiny, consistent actions rewire your brain for confidence. Think of it like a workout, but<br/> for your courage.</p>
            <h2><b>Ready to transform "I can't" into "I did"?</b></h2>
